# Term.ooo Python

This is my prototype of trying to recreate the [term.ooo][link]  game using python, it is still in the early stages

## Features

- Selects a random word from a JSON with more than 1000 words in Portuguese
- Checks if the word sent in input is in the JSON word list
- Checks if the word sent by the input is the word chosen at random
- If the word sent by the input has equal letters in equal positions of the random word, it will return a printout showing what they are

## Future Features

- Return letters that are in the random word, but are not in the same position
- Return using colors the letters of the word
