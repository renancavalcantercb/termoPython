# Term.ooo Python

This is my prototype of trying to recreate the [term.ooo][link]  game using python, it is still in the early stages

## Features

- [x] Selects a random word from a JSON with more than 1000 words in Portuguese
- [x] Checks if the word sent in input is in the JSON word list
- [x] Checks if the word sent by the input is the word chosen at random
- [x] If the word sent by the input has equal letters in equal positions of the random word, it will return a printout showing what they are


## Future Features

- [x] Return letters that are in the random word, but are not in the same position 
- [x] Return using colors the letters of the word 
- [ ] Check for repeated letters
